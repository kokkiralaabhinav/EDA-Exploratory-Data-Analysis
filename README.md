# EDA-Exploratory-Data-Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis helps us to understand and analyze raw data by preprocessing and drawing insights. This project is done using some Python Visualization tools and some machine learning Techniques.
## TYPES OF EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS:
Univariate Non-graphical, Multivariate Non-graphical, Univariate graphical, Multivariate graphical.19
## What is EDA process in data science-
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyze the data using visual techniques. It is used to discover trends, patterns, or to check assumptions with the help of statistical summary and graphical representations.
## What is EDA in Python-
EDA is applied to investigate the data and summarize the key insights. It will give you the basic understanding of your data, it's distribution, null values and much more. You can either explore data using graphs or through some python functions.
